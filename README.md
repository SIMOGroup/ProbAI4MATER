# ProbAI4MATER
This repository provides the demonstration simulation dataset and Python codes of the probabilistic artificial intelligence framework for sustainable MATER (Mitigated emissions, Affordable economy, Transformative energy, Ecological resilience, Responsible living), application to a case study of Vietnamese buildings, with the following features:

- Introducing a new paradigm, the sustainable MATER model, which is simpler and more actionable than the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (UN's SDGs);
- Proposing a synergistic probabilistic artificial intelligence to simultaneously address all five MATER sustainability goals under climate change uncertainty;
- Applying to a typical Vietnamese residential building in Ho Chi Minh City, considering building energy consumption in its 75-year life cycle under five climate change scenarios provided by the World Bank;
- Employing Termus Plus energy simulation, ANOVA F-test, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Conditional probabilistic sampling, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN), Mathematical statistics, Confidence-based MATER objective functions, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP).
